# CS3733 Software Engineering Final Project in Collaboration with Brigham and Women's Hospital


## Project Overview
This project is the culmination of the Software Engineering course at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. In this project, our goal was to create a Java app that would be used by the Brigham and Women's Hospital employees and would complete various tasks. One of the main aspects of this project was creating a graphical map editor that would be used to display various service requests (Lab service request, Meal service requests, etc.) and their locations on the map. In addition to these requests, it would display all of the equipment in the hospital and their locations. Along with this map editor, there would be a dashboard that would display most of the data that showed up on the map that would be easy to understand for the employees. Separate from the map editor many service requests would be useful to the employees for whatever they needed. If they needed a meal for their patient they could request it and it would be written to the Apache Derby database to be completed.
